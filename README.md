# 🌱 Master's Degree Project: Kinship Rules and Agrobiodiversity of Manioc
## 📖 Introduction
Welcome to the repository for my Master's Degree Project! This project explores the effect of kinship rules and the inheritance of plants on the agrobiodiversity of manioc. It includes several components to simulate the reproduction of Unidades Domésticas (UD) and the inheritance of manioc varieties, along with validations to ensure model accuracy.

Before running the project, install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file. You can do this by running the following command:


pip install -r requirements.txt

📂 The literature folder contains valuable data and references about manioc diversity in traditional communities. This resource provides crucial context for understanding the project.

## 🚀 Running the Model or Validations
To run the model or perform validation checks, execute the main.py file. Instructions for running the model and validations are included directly in the main.py file.

🛠️ Main Components:
Experiments:

1. Effect of kinship rules and inheritance of plants in agrobiodiversity
2. Effect of different parameters on agrobiodiversity 

Validation:

1. Populational behavior
2. Kinship systems


Simply run the main.py file as follows:

py main.py

## 🧪 Working with Jupyter Notebooks
If you want to view the experiments and simulations in Jupyter notebooks, you can find them under the simulations directory. These notebooks contain visualizations and they maybe are easier to modify.

## 📂 Folder Structure
Here's a quick overview of the repository's organization:


├── Literature -------> Literature folder

├── Main  ------------> Main folder.

├── Simulations ------> Jupyter notebooks for experiments and simulations

├── model_class ------> Classes of the model.

├── not_used_erased --> Just some preliminar codes. Do not judge me by lookin at this floder :'(

├── to_get_data ------> Methods used to get data in some points of the model. Some were not used.

└── README.md --------> Project documentation (this file)
